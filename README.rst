Usody Hardware Metadata
#########################
An open source tool to capture hardware data about computers generating a report on JSON file.

By default Hardware Metadata generates a report of the hardware
characteristics of the computer using lshw, dmidecode, hwinfo, lscpi and smartmontools packages.

You must run as root / sudo.

Installation
*************
Hardware Metadata should work in any Linux as long as it has all dependencies installed.

In Debian 11 Bullseye following installation steps:

1. Clone this repository and go to the repository main folder.

.. code-block::

    git clone https://github.com/usody/hardware-metadata.git

2. Make sure we have all required packages installed, `debian packages <requirements.debian.txt>`_ and `python packages <requirements.txt>`_ . You can install all HWMD dependencies like the following way:

.. code-block::

    sudo make install_HWMD_dependencies

3. If the previous step 2 fails, we can manually install HWMD dependencies. On bullseye, you can do it like the following way:

.. code-block::

    echo "deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bullseye-backports main contrib" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/backports.list
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -t bullseye-backports lshw=02.19*
    sudo apt install --no-install-recommends python3 python3-dev python3-pip dmidecode smartmontools hwinfo
    sudo pip3 install python-dateutil==2.8.2 hashids==1.3.1 requests~=2.21.0 python-decouple==3.3 colorlog==6.7.0

Run Hardware Metadata
**********************
Execute Hardware Metadata like sudo/root:

.. code-block::

    sudo make run

Also you can run Hardware Metadata manually like the following way:

.. code-block::

    sudo python3 <project-folder>/hwmetadata_core.py

At the end of the execution, generates a json file with the hardware information collected from your computer,
called '*{date}_{wbid}_snapshot.json*'.

Build Hardware Metadata ISO
****************************
To generate ISO image of Hardware Metadata based on Debian 11 Bullseye, execute:

.. code-block::

    sudo make build_bullseye

At the end of the execution, generate an ISO image inside '*<project-folder>/build/wbiso/{WB_VERSION}_WB.iso*'.

If you want to clean up all the files generated by the image (including iso file), execute:

.. code-block::

    sudo make build_clean

If you want to boot HWMD ISO, make sure you have installed *qemu-system*, execute:

.. code-block::

    sudo make boot_iso


Run tests
*********
1. Clone this repository and go to the repository main folder.

.. code-block::

    git clone https://github.com/usody/hardware-metadata.git

2. Execute on project folder:

.. code-block::

    sudo make test
